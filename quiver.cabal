description:        /Quiver/ is a powerful stream processing library for
                    combinatorial and monadic representation of computations
                    over both inductive and coinductive data streams.
                    .
                    It is similar to Gabriel Gonzalez's /pipes/ and
                    Michael Snoyman's /conduit/, but generalises both
                    with support for functor-based computations and
                    a clean support for finite (i.e., inductive) data
                    streams, both upstream and downstream of the computation
                    being defined.
